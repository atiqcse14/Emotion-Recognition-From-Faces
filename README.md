# Emotion-Recognition-From-Faces

Artificial Intelligence's rapid development has made a significant contribution to the technological world. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have achieved considerable success in various applications such as classification systems, recommendation systems, pattern recognition, and so on, since classical algorithms have failed to match human needs in real time. Emotion plays a vital role in determining the thoughts, behaviour and feelings of a human. An emotion recognition system can be built by utilizing the benefits of deep learning and different applications such as feedback analysis, face unlocking etc. can be implemented with good accuracy. The main focus of this work is to use a Transfer Learning model from the built in Keras function which is MobileNetV2, that classifies 6 different human facial emotions. The model is trained, tested and validated using the manually collected image dataset. 36.7\% prediction accuracy was achieved using this model on our own images.
